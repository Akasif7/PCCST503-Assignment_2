# PCCST503 Assignment 2 - Factored Guard-Effect Embedding

A second, independently designed solution based on finite-domain guard masks,
assignment features, typed port masks and regression-based composition.
The core representation never enumerates the Cartesian state space.

## Reproduce

Requires Python 3.10+ and NumPy:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python make_dataset.py
python experiments.py
python -m unittest -v
```

Results are deterministic except timing. Eight tests include 80 seeded random
three-step compositions checked against a separate exhaustive interpreter.
To rebuild the PDF after experiments:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-report.txt
python build_report.py
```

## API

```python
import json
from embedding import FactoredEmbedding, similarity
p = json.load(open('dataset.json'))['problems'][0]
m = FactoredEmbedding(p)
a, b, c = p['capabilities'][:3]
state = m.encode(p['initial_state'], 'state')
goal = m.encode(p['goal'], 'goal')
encoded = m.encode(a)
print(m.compatibility(a, b))
composite = m.compose([a, b, c])
print(composite.guards, composite.effects)
print(m.goal_satisfied(composite, p['initial_state'], p['goal']))
print(m.execute(composite, p['initial_state'],
                p['available_resources'], {'cart_id': 'valid'}))
# Compose using only numbers plus the fixed schema, without original specs:
numeric_only = [m.from_vector(m.encode(x).values.copy()) for x in [a,b,c]]
rebuilt = m.compose(numeric_only)
assert m.encode(rebuilt) is rebuilt
print(similarity(encoded, m.encode(p['capabilities'][4])))
```

compose([a,b,c]) means a then b then c. Encoded composites can be nested.
Similarity measures guard/effect resemblance; compatibility is a directional
state-and-interface check. goal_relevance counts directly established goal
restrictions; goal_satisfied simulates a given sequence from an initial state.
Neither method searches for a plan.

execute is a deterministic specification simulator, not an API/GUI/database
adapter. It enforces resource, availability and finite input-domain gates.
Declared port types are schema labels; output values are not generated or sampled.
The schema is fixed per problem and is required to interpret stored vectors.
The implementation supports conjunctions of unary finite-domain predicates and
constant assignments. It does not support cross-variable comparisons or
conditional effects. Extensional equivalence deliberately shares semantic blocks.

The dataset is synthetic. The report distinguishes exactness for the supported
formal fragment from claims about arbitrary applications or learned prediction.
